                <p>In this exercise we will customise the TEI to remove those elements we do not
                    think we'll use. In order to customise a TEI schema you need to know which
                    elements you want to use, and which you don't, which sometimes involves a
                    lengthy document analysis process. In our case we'll shortcut that by telling
                    you what to include or not include. You will learn to create a new schema, and
                    download and use it in oXygen. You'll learn how to constrain the acceptable
                    values for an attribute, and require its presence. You'll have a look at the
                    underlying TEI ODD XML format which enables this customisation.</p>

                <p>Load up the file 'spoilers/ex06.xml' in oXygen and save it under a new name. Open
                    up a web browser and go to <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/"

                <p>oXygen already knows about the TEI, it comes bundled with an open source TEI
                    Framework (oxygen-tei) that helps it understand how TEI files are meant to work. <list>
                        <item>In oXygen with 'spoilers/ex06.xml' (or whatever you saved it as)
                            loaded, move the cursor to just inside a paragraph after the opening
                                <gi>p</gi>.</item>
                        <item>If you type a '&lt;' at this point, as you know, oXygen will give you
                            a dropdown list of all the elements allowed inside a <gi>p</gi>. </item>
                        <item>Scroll down the list of elements, referring to the pop-up tooltip if
                            you want to know what the elements are for. Notice such elements as
                                <gi>address</gi>, <gi>camera</gi>, <gi>incident</gi>,
                                <gi>metamark</gi>, and <gi>notatedMusic</gi>.</item>
                        <item>Hit escape to leave the dropdown menu and delete the '&lt;' that you
                            had added.</item>
                        <item>You certainly have a lot of choices for elements you can add here! But
                            in any project it is unlikely that you are going to want all those
                            choices. Also, increased choice of what elements to add can lead to
                            greater human error and inconsistency, and we don't want that!</item>

                                    why not call it something like 'My special TEI customisation'. </item>

                <p>Modules are groupings of TEI elements for structural or semantic reasons. For
                    example there is a 'dictionary' module which contains most of the elements
                    needed for writing dictionaries. If you aren't writing a dictionary, you
                    probably don't need that module. Below is a list of all the TEI modules:</p>

                <p>Removing elements is all well and good and is the first step in customising your
                    schema, but we want to do more. Let's customise the <att>type</att> attribute on
                        <gi>div</gi> to only allow certain values. <list>
                        <item>Go back to Roma in your browser (hopefully you didn't shut it and lose
                            all your work?)</item>

                        <item>Click on the 'textstructure' module name. </item>
                        <item> On the row containing 'div' click on 'Change Attributes' on the far
                            right-hand side. </item>
                        <item>This should take you to a page listing all the possible attributes on
                                <gi>div</gi>. This is also where you would include/exclude use of
                            those attributes if we wanted to change that. </item>
                        <item>Scroll down to 'type' and click on it. This should take you to a page
                            allowing you to set various options for the <att>type</att> attribute.
                            Set them as follows: <list>
                                <item><hi>Is it optional?</hi> This allows us to control whether the
                                    attribute is <emph>required</emph> or not. Let's make our
                                        <att>type</att> attribute required, so click 'no' it is not
                                    optional.</item>
                                <item><hi>Contents</hi> This would allow us to change what type of
                                    datatype is allowed and how many times it should appear. Let's
                                    leave that just as it is as 'Text'. </item>
                                <item><hi>Default value</hi> would allow us to set a default value
                                    for the attribute if you didn't supply one. Let's force
                                    ourselves to supply one and so leave this blank. </item>
                                <item><hi>Closed list?</hi> enables us to say whether our list of
                                    values is fixed, or merely a suggestion. Let's be rigorous and
                                    say that it is a closed list. Answer yes! </item>
                                <item><hi>List of values</hi> is where we give the values we want to
                                    supply to the schema as valid values for the <att>type</att>
                                    attribute on <gi>div</gi>. We give this as a comma-separated

                        <item>Choose one of the Relax NG formats from the dropdown list. </item>

                        <item>Go back to oXygen, and the 'ex06.xml' (or whatever you renamed it as)
                            file, and go to the 'Document' -> 'Validate' -> 'Reset Cache and
                            Validate' menu item. </item>
                        <item>You document should validate fine and you should have a happy green
                            square. </item>
                        <item>Go to the first <gi>div</gi> tag in the document that looks like
                                <code>&lt;div type="prose"&gt;</code> and change it to be just
                                <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. </item>
                        <item>Your document should not be valid. You should have an angry red
                            square. If it is still valid 'Reset Cache and Validate' again, and
                            ensure that it is pointing to the correct schema. The error message it
                            should be providing is that that <code>element 'div' missing required
                                attribute 'type'</code> or something similar. </item>
                        <item>Put your cursor immediately after the 'v' in <gi>div</gi> and press
                            space. oXygen should provide a dropdown list of attributes available on
                                <gi>div</gi>. Scroll down until you find <att>type</att> and note
                            that it is in bold. This is because we made it required. </item>
                        <item>Select <att>type</att> and notice that oXygen gives you another
                            dropdown list of the possible values. This is because we provided the
                            values and said that this was a closed value list. </item>
                        <item>Choose one of the values, perhaps 'prose'. Your document should again
                            be valid and have a happy green square. </item>

                    the OxGarage web service. When you generated the documentation this used
                    OxGarage and you didn't even notice!</p>
                <p>Some people write their TEI ODD customisation files entirely in XML and do not
                    use the Roma web interface at all. There are a number of things that the Roma
                    web interface can't do which the TEI ODD language underneath is capable of.
                    Notice, for example, that you weren't able to provide descriptions of each of
                    the attribute values you entered for <att>type</att>? You can do that in the
                    underlying XML. Some people do a combination of both Roma and hand editing.</p>
