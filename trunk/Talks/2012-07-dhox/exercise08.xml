                    <p>We're going to mark up the parts of speech for individual words in
                        the transcription of spoken text we encoded in the previous
                        exercise. To do this we'll first put in a <gi>taxonomy</gi>
                        element to refer to with standard linguistic parts of speech.
                        We'll then tag individual words, and use an attribute to refer
                        back to this taxonomy. We'll then realise how hard this is to do
                        manually, and we'll find a way to cheat! Finally we'll transform
                        our XML file, not only into a standard web page displaying the
                        transcribed text, but also to a page grouping together the words
                        we've marked up.</p>

                        'spoilers/ex07.xml'. </p>

                    <p>In order to have something to refer back to we're going to insert a
                            <gi>taxonomy</gi> element into our file. <list>
                            <item>Immediate after the closing <gi>/profileDesc</gi> tag,
                                add a <gi>encodingDesc</gi> with a <gi>classDecl</gi>
                                inside it. </item>
                            <item>Making sure the cursor is in-between the starting and

                    <head>Marking Up Part of Speech</head>
                    <p>Let's mark up some words! <list>
                            <item>We need to wrap a <gi>w</gi> element around each of the
                                words in the three utterances. Highlight the first one,
                                and use 'control-e' to then surround it with this tag.
                                Then highlight the second one, and press 'control-/' to
                                surround with the tag you just used. Do that until
                                'changed over time?'</item>
                            <item>Each word though needs to get an <att>ana</att>
                                attribute added to it. Either do this manually or think
                                how you might search for <gi>w</gi> and replace it with
                                    <gi>w ana=""</gi>. </item>
                            <item>Now the problem is that each of those <att>ana</att>
                                attributes needs a value! It needs to be '#' followed by
                                one of the <att>xml:id</att> values in our
                                    <gi>taxonomy</gi>. We know that you might not
                                automatically know what category each word is, so we've
                                listed what our first three utterances look like below:

                    <head>How to Cheat</head>
                    <p>That was an awful lot of work. In fact, some of those entries might
                        be wrong. Why is that? Well, it is because we fed a plain text
                        version of the transcription to an automatic part-of-speech tagger
                        for English at <ref target="http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws/"
                            >http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws/</ref>. This has some
                        limitations, but makes good guesses. Go and skim-read the web page
                        about it quickly. <list>
                            <item>So we cheated in determining which parts-of-speech these
                                words were, so we can hardly stop you cheating if you
                                don't want to manually mark up the rest of the spoken text
                                in this file!</item>
                            <item>We'd highly recommend, instead, that you save your
                                current file (perhaps calling it 'exercise08.xml'?), and
                                open up 'spoilers/ex08.xml' which has a finished version
                                of the file! (Just to save time you understand). </item>
                            <item>In a real-world situation you probably wouldn't manually
                                tag a corpus like this in any case. You would run scripts
                                over it (as we did) in order to automatically process it
                                and convert the output of a part-of-speech tagger. </item>

                        </list>

                    <head>Transforming Your File</head>
                    <p>But what can we do with this markup now that we have ... erm...
                        added it? (Ok, loaded it by opening 'spoilers/ex08.xml'.) <list>
                            <item>Let's transform this file with an XSLT stylesheet we
                                have prepared! XSLT is a transformation language for XML
                                which allows us to turn our XML files into other things
                                (such as other XML, HTML, DOCX, PDF, TXT, etc.) and
                                control what happens to them.</item>
                            <item>In order to relate the XML file to a stylesheet we have
                                to associate the two together. Go to the 'Document' ->
                                'XML Document' -> 'Associate XSLT/CSS Stylesheet'
                                menu.</item>
                            <item>Click on the 'XSLT' tab, and click the folder icon to
                                browse for a file.</item>
                            <item>Choose 'spoilers/parts-of-speech.xsl' as the XSLT file
                                to use.</item>
                            <item>You should notice that oXygen adds a new line to the top
                                of your file that looks something like:
                                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
&lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="parts-of-speech.xsl"?>

                            </item>
                            <item>This allows the XML document to know what stylesheet it
                                can use to transform the document. </item>
                            <item>Select from the 'Document' -> 'Transformation' menu,
                                'Configure Transformation Scenario'.</item>
                            <item>On the window that appears select 'XML Stylesheet
                                Processing Instruction', and then click 'Transform
                                Now'.</item>
                            <item>If everything has worked perfectly (sometimes settings
                                change across versions of oXygen), then your web browser
                                should open a web page containing the text of this
                                interview. It should have a table-of-contents which allows
                                you to see two different versions of the text. One as you
                                might expect, the other with words grouped by part of
                                speech. (If for any reason it does not open, simply open
                                up 'spoilers/parts-of-speech.html' in a web browser as a
                                demonstration.)</item>
                            <item>Have a look at both of these. Hover the mouse over the
                                words in both cases and note the extra information you
                                should get in a tooltip.</item>
