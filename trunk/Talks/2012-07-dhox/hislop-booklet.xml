 <lb/>
Lee (24.27-24.36): <lb/>
So em d-em having read [clicking sound: 0.17s] the Wipers Times <lb/>
now and and your [pause: 0.62s] view that  <lb/>
th th the thirties was that that <lb/>
prisonment you say  <lb/>
 <lb/>
Hislop (24.36): <lb/>
Yeah. <lb/>
 <lb/>
Lee (24.36-24.42) <lb/>
[clicking sound: 1.28s] looking back <lb/>
on a failed piece [pause: 0.35s] <lb/>
has your attitude  <lb/>
to the to the War Poets <lb/>
Wilfred Owen Sassoon [pause: 0.30s] <lb/>
changed over time? <lb/>
 <lb/>
Hislop (24.42-27.09): <lb/>
[pause: 0.76s]Not really I mean <lb/>
I've-I read the Owen again, em [pause: 0.20s]  <lb/>
very recently  <lb/>
and just thought how brilliant [laughs in -iant syllable] <lb/>
[pause: 0.40s] um those poems are [pause: 0.50s] <lb/>
um [pause: 0.65s] and it's [pause: 0.70s] it's not that um [pause: 0.70s] <lb/>
I don't think they're any good <lb/>
I just think there were other voices [pause: 0.50s] <lb/>
um and [pause: 0.50s]they have been taken  <lb/>
as all there was <lb/>
I mean I think they do <lb/>
express the horror [pause: 0.63s] <lb/>
quite wonderfully [pause: 0.50s] <lb/>
um it's like the [pause: 0.45s] <lb/>
the painting of the um [pause: 0.55s] <lb/>
'The Gassed' [Note: John Singer Sargent, 1918] <lb/>
[pause: 0.60s] um that's um Sargent <lb/>
 <lb/>
Lee (25.13): <lb/>
Yes. <lb/>
 <lb/>
Hislop (25.13-26.35) <lb/>
um [pause: 0.50s] which I saw again and <lb/>
just was completely blown away <lb/>
by how brilliant he was <lb/>
and that [pause: 1.15s] that is what the <lb/>
First World War was about [pause: 0.75s] <lb/>
[clicking sound:0.06s] <lb/>
but [pause: 0.95s] <lb/>
there were some other [clicking sound: 0.5s] bits [pause: 0.20s] <lb/>
um, and it is [pause: 0.50s] I think <lb/>
MacDonald has done it really well in <lb/>
his 'Voices' and again <lb/>
in those pictures you you [pause: 0.75s] <lb/>
yes there is the horror [pause: 0.40s] <lb/>
um and um horror like you haven't seen before <lb/>
and that's expressed <lb/>
but [pause: 0.60s] um [pause: 0.65s]you know <lb/>
it lasted for four years <lb/>
and [pause: 0.81s] not every day was the first day  <lb/>
of the Battle of the Somme [pause: 0.70s] <lb/>
and there are [pause: 1.05s] <lb/>
other things that were happening [pause: 0.90s] <lb/>
in the trenches and whatever that were <lb/>
um [pause: 0.70s] worth remembering <lb/>
A and it was so [pause: 0.40s] <lb/>
certainly vital in changing <lb/>
how Britain was [pause: 1.80s] <lb/>
And when I came [pause: 0.65s] <lb/>
I was doing that programme about the memorials <lb/>
and I thought [pause: 1.30s] <lb/>
the first one I saw where [pause: 0.60s] <lb/>
there were no ranks [pause: 1.40s] <lb/>
the dead were all just listed [pause: 0.80s] <lb/>
um and this is the first time in British history [pause: 0.40s] um [pause: 0.35s] <lb/>
and it was because of the people in the trenches said  <lb/>
"we fought together, [pause: 0.30s] we're gonna die together" [pause: 0.35s] um [pause: 0.40s] <lb/>
and it was that feeling of [pause: 0.80s] <lb/>
well [pause: 0.75s] something really <lb/>
fundamental had changed [Note: syllables -damental while laughing] [[pause: 0.45s] <lb/>
um, and when they came back [pause: 0.65s] <lb/>
[clicking sound: 0.8s] you know [pause: 0.82s] <lb/>
flawed for the rest of the century [pause: 0.45s] <lb/>
that's when it all happened [pause: 0.30s] <lb/>
 <lb/>
Lee (26.35) <lb/>
hmm <lb/>
 <lb/>
Hislop (26.36-27.09) <lb/>
I think it's difficult to read the history of the century <lb/>
certainly the middle bits of it [pause: 0.30s] <lb/>
without remembering that [pause: 1.20s] <lb/>
someone said there was an enormous black cloud over [pause: 1.23s]  <lb/>
Britain [pause: 1.12s] of grief [pause: 1.00s] <lb/>
um [pause: 0.50s] and it's just the fact that <lb/>
everyone had lost someone [pause: 0.90s] <lb/>
and um [pause: 0.60s] <lb/>
we tend to assume that everyone goes on <lb/>
and it's normal and they do their things <lb/>
but actually for almost the entire country [pause: 0.83s] <lb/>
everybody was spending every day <lb/>
some bit of it thinking [pause: 0.92s] <lb/>
"they're dead" [pause: 1.45s] I always find that extraordinary [pause: 0.30s] <lb/>
 <lb/>
