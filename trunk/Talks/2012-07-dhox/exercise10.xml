                <p>This exercise is designed to give you some exposure to some of the
                    other TEI resources available online. Not only will you use OxGarage
                    to convert files to and from TEI, but be shown the limitations of such
                    conversions. You'll be directed to more parts of the TEI Guidelines,
                    the TEI-C Website, and the community-developed Wiki. The process for
                    submitting and reviewing bugs and feature requests will be reviewed,
                    along with how to subscribe to the TEI-L mailing list. The TEI By
                    Examples website will be suggested as a good place for further
                    self-directed study. </p>

                <head>OxGarage: Have a quick play</head>
                <p>OxGarage is a pipelining transformation engine with a RESTful Web
                    Service (which in this case means it can be used by programs as well
                    as on the web) that converts documents from one format to another. <list>
                        <item>Go to <ref
                                target="http://oxgarage.oucs.ox.ac.uk:8080/ege-webclient"

                        <item>Click on 'Documents' and select "TEI P5 XML Document" as
                            your input. When you do so a list of possible conversion
                            targets should appear on the right. Choose "Microsoft Word
                            Document (.docx)". </item>
                        <item>When you've done this a 'Choose File' button should appear
                            on the upper left. Click the button and navigate to your
                            finished (if well-formed and valid) file from way back in
                            Exercise 2. (If you didn't finish this, choose
                            'spoilers/ex02.xml' instead).</item>
                        <item>Click convert and open the document in Microsoft Word. Note
                            the information that is retained and the information that is
                            lost. </item>
                        <item>Try this again, but use a more complex file such the one
                            from Exercise 6 (if you didn't finish this, choose
                            'spoilers/ex06.xml' instead). Note how in conversion to DOCX
                            format that it attempts to interpret additions, deletions,
                            unclear, expansions, and representing them in presentational
                            markup. </item>
                        <item>Try converting to a variety of other formats and see the
                            results you get. (Note: Not all conversions are equal!)

                <head>More on OxGarage</head>
                <p>Of course, OxGarage isn't just about converting TEI files to other
                    formats, it can also convert other formats to TEI! See <ref
                        target="http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/oxgarage/"
                        >http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/oxgarage/</ref> for more information. <list>
                        <item>Take one of the formats you have converted (e.g. DOCX) a
                            file in, and edit that file in Microsoft Word. Add some new
                            text, and divisions to them. Use 'heading2' style (or similar)
                            to add a new division at some point and add a few lines of
                            text.</item>
                        <item>If they are available, use some of the in-line styles the
                            Word provides, and mark some text with them.</item>
                        <item>Try converting the file back to TEI and seeing what is
                            preserved (and what isn't!)</item>
                        <item>Although most conversions are 'lossy', this is a good
                            mechanism for getting a large number of documents into a basic
                            TEI P5 XML structure, to then do further conversion work on
                            this. One of the things we do for funded research projects is
                            take on the work of 'up-converting' their files from Word to
                            TEI P5, but deducing as much additional structure and markup
                            as we can. Usually this kind of conversion is different for
                            every project, but builds on the common base that we have put
                            into OxGarage. </item>

                <p> The TEI Guidelines are the main output of the TEI Consortium and
                    contain chapters on a wide variety of TEI recommendations. Hopefully
                    you've had a chance to read a bit of them already. <list>

                        </item>
                        <item>Note the division into 'Front Matter', 'Text Body', and
                            'Back Matter', look at the kinds of things present in each
                            section.</item>
                        <item>Choose a chapter from the 'Text Body' section and note how
                            the left-hand table of contents shows the general divisions
                            (and previous/next chapters) and how the small right-hand
                            navigation allows you to move forward/backwards through the
                            sections.</item>
                        <item>Notice also that greyed out 'Â¶' character after any
                            sub-division (or sub-sub-division) heading. This is a link to
                            that section in particular. This is useful if you want to cite
                            a section of the TEI Guidelines in conversation. (e.g. on the
                            TEI-L mailing list) </item>
                        <item>Notice that all elements, attributes, classes, and datatypes
                            are links through to the reference pages about that object. </item>
                        <item>If you look at the examples provided, most of them will have
                            green backgrounds, which means that this snippet is valid in a
                            TEI file (assuming it was put in the right place). Some
                            examples might have amber (feasibly valid if some missing
                            elements were provided), or red (invalid against the default
                            schema). Sometimes it is necessary to show examples which are
                            invalid to demonstrate mixing of namespaces or when discussing
                            XML itself.</item>
                        <item>Click on any element name in the prose to go to the
                            reference page for that element. The information here can be
                            very useful when you want to look up what the definition of an
                            element is, where it is allowed, or what is allowed inside it.
                            At the bottom are one or more examples, and a link through to
                            a list of all the examples in the TEI Guidelines which use

                <p>The TEI-L mailing list is the main form of communication within the TEI
                    Community. Questions on there range from those entirely new to the TEI
                    to those who have been using the TEI for a couple decades. You should
                    not be afraid to post straightforward sounding questions, just make
                    sure you've checked the TEI Guidelines and Website first and are clear
                    about what you want to do and why you are confused. You will almost
                    certainly be guaranteed an answer, sometimes several competing ones!<list>

                <p>TEI By Example provides a variety of freely-available online tutorials
                    the demonstrate a number of different stages in encoding a TEI file.
                    There is a general introduction to text encoding and step-by-step
                    tutorials provide introductions to eight different aspects of TEI
                    markup with lots of examples. Real life examples are provided for each
                    tutorial and the theory provided can be tested with tests and
                    exercises. A tools section gives an annotated overview of XML encoding
                    technology and a validator for fragments of TEI. <list>

                <p>This is the last exercise of this workshop, and we hope you feel like
                    you've had a (quick!) but broad overview of some of the things the TEI
                    can do. Your learning is by no means complete! Read the TEI
                    Guidelines! Use TEI-By-Example! Join the TEI-L mailing list and ask
                    questions! If you have Oxford specific TEI questions you can email us
                    on <ref target="mailto:tei@oucs.ox.ac.uk">tei@oucs.ox.ac.uk</ref>, but
                    you are more likely to get a wider range of answers on the TEI-L
                    mailing list. All of the exercises will be made available from a link
