        <head>Learning Outcomes</head>
        <p>When you successfully complete this exercise you should be able to: <list type="bulleted">
            <item>Undertake conversion of a transcription of a document </item>
            <item>Use <gi>add</gi>, <gi>del</gi> and <gi>subst</gi> effectively </item>
            <item>Use <gi>choice</gi> with <gi>abbr</gi> and <gi>expan</gi>

      <!-- Summary -->
      <div>
        <head>Summary</head>
        <p>In this exercise you will take a transcription, already partly in TEI but with a bespoke
          transcription notation, and convert it fully to TEI P5 XML. You'll learn how to use
            <gi>add</gi>, <gi>del</gi>, <gi>subst</gi>, <gi>choice</gi>,<gi>abbr</gi>,
            <gi>expan</gi>, and <gi>unclear</gi> in both simple and nested manners to indicate some
          complex transcriptional phenomena. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Starting Up</head>
        <p> In this case we're starting with a sample file that we have created for you. Load up the
          file called: 'preface.xml' in the oXygen XML editor. Check that the file is well-formed
          and valid. Note that: <list>

            <item>There is a minimal header with an <gi>msDesc</gi>.
            </item>
            <item>There is a commented-out plain text edition of this preface, edited by J.
              Stallworthy. (This is just to give you a reading copy of a clean text). </item>
            <item>There is a transcription with a bespoke notation of "(deleted: 'some text')" by a
              transcriber to show what was deleted, added, and other aspects. In some case additions
              and deletions are nested together as a single act with an extra set of parentheses. In
              other cases deletions are made inside additions. </item>
            <item>There is an image of the manuscript page in the 'preface-ms.jpg' file. Have a look
              at this, the commented out edited version, and the transcription of the manuscript.
            </item>
          </list>
        </p>
      </div>


      <div>
        <head>Using <att>rend</att></head>
        <p> Note that the <gi>head</gi> inside the division has a content of: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<head>(underlined:'Preface.')</head>      
    </egXML>
          <list>
            <item>Remove the "(underlined:'" and "')" so that you are left with just the text. </item>
            <item>Add a <att>rend</att> attribute with a value of 'underline'.</item>
            <item> You should have a <gi>head</gi> that looks something like:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
 <head rend="underline">Preface.</head>  
</egXML>
            </item>
          </list>
        </p>
      </div>



      <div>
        <head>Second Paragraph</head>
        <p>Let's change some of this transcription notation to real markup in the second paragraph
          (the first has no transcription notation). <list>
            <item>Change <code>(added below: 'about glory, honour,') </code> to be
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<add place="below">about glory, honour,</add>              
            </egXML>
            </item>
            <item>The next is an example of a substitution, a deletion and addition provided as a
              single act, followed by a deletion. Change <code>((deleted:'battles, and glory of
                battles') (added above:'deeds or lands')) (deleted 'or land,') </code> to be
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<subst>
  <del rend="stroked">battles, and glory of battles</del>
  <add place="above">deeds or lands</add>
</subst>
<del rend="stroked">or land,</del>                
              </egXML>
            </item>
            <item>Replace <code> ((deleted:'or') (added below:'or anything about')) </code> with
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<subst>
  <del rend="stroked">or</del>
  <add place="below">or anything about</add>
</subst>                 
              </egXML>
            </item>
            <item>The transcriber has marked a passage that was unclear in transcription as
                <code>(unclear, scribbled: 'majesty')</code>. Replace this with
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<unclear reason="scribbled">majesty</unclear>                
              </egXML>
            </item>
            <item>The transcriber has recorded an abbreviation with its expansion as
                <code>domin(ion)</code>. This is meant to mean that 'domin' is what it is on the
              page, but that it should be expanded to 'dominion'. Encode this as:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<choice>
  <abbr>domin</abbr>
  <expan>domin<ex>ion</ex></expan>
</choice> 
</egXML>
              The <gi>ex</gi> element gives the supplied letters in the expanded form. </item>
            <item>Replace <code>(deleted:'whatever') </code> with
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
 <del rend="stroked">whatever</del>
            </egXML>
            </item>
            <item>This concludes your second paragraph, and has given you some experience in marking
              up <gi>add</gi>, <gi>del</gi>, and wrapping those in <gi>subst</gi>, also using
                <gi>unclear</gi> and <gi>choice</gi> with <gi>abbr</gi>, <gi>expan</gi> and
                <gi>ex</gi>. Your paragraph should look something like: </item>
          </list>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<p> Nor is it <add place="below">about glory, honour,</add> about 
<subst>
  <del rend="stroked">battles, and glory of battles</del>
  <add place="above">deeds or lands</add>
</subst>
<del rend="stroked">or land,</del>
<subst>
  <del rend="stroked">or</del>
  <add place="below">or anything about</add>
</subst> any might, <unclear reason="scribbled">majesty</unclear>, <choice>
  <abbr>domin</abbr>
  <expan>domin<ex>ion</ex></expan>
</choice> or power <lb/>
<del rend="stroked">whatever</del> except War. </p>                
              </egXML>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Third Paragraph</head>
        <p> The third paragraph introduces nesting additions/deletions inside additions for when
          someone has added something, and then changed their mind by adding more, and/or deleting
          the addition. <list>
            <item>Change <code>(added left: 'Above all') (deleted: 'Its') ((added above:'I am')
                (deleted:'This book')) </code> to be:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<add place="left">Above all </add>
<del rend="stroked">Its </del>
<subst>
    <add place="above">I am </add>
    <del rend="stroked">This book</del>
</subst>                
              </egXML>
            </item>
            <item>Modify <code>(added above:'(deleted: '(unclear, unsure:'center')')') </code> which
              contains an unclear bit of text that has been deleted, inside an addition, to be
              something like:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<add place="above">
      <del rend="stroked"><unclear>center</unclear></del>
</add>                              </egXML>
            </item>
            <item> Modify <code>((added left:'My') (deleted:"It's")) (added above:'(deleted:'The')')
              </code> which has a substitution with an addition and a deletion as well as an
              addition which is then deleted.
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<subst>
  <add place="left">My </add>
  <del rend="stroked">It's </del>

</add>                
              </egXML>
            </item>

            <item>Finish up the last couple of deletions in this paragraph and it should look
              something like: </item>
          </list>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Fourth Paragraph</head>
        <p>The fourth paragraph has more of the same, but also a deletion with a nested addition
          with both a substitution and standalone deletion. <list>
            <item>Change <code>(deleted:'I have no hesistation in') (deleted:'making public')

              deletion (of 'this generation') with a nested addition with a substitution and a
              deletion to: </item>
          </list>

        <p><list>
            <item> (That is quite complicated in terms of additions and substitions!) Change the

              Read some of the chapter on Representation of Primary Sources: <ref

            <item>At the bottom of that chapter you can find a list of elements added by the
