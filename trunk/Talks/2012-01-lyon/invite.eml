Dear colleagues and friends,

I would like to draw your attention to some important information about the
Lyon days of study to which you were so kind as to accept to participate.

1) Travel and accomodation

Those of you staying at a hotel have a room reserved for the night of Jan.
22, under their own name at the Hotel Dubost:
http://www.hotel-dubost.com/
I am very sorry that we were not able to prepay the room, so you will have
to pay yourself, and then we will reimburse you. Please be careful to keep
all receipt,s they will be needed for the reimbursement (I guess you have
probably hear of the legendary French administration's power of nuisance...=
)

Those of you coming by plane will find it easy to take the Rhonexpress
tram/shuttle: http://www.rhonexpress.fr/ which will take you to one of the
2 Lyon main train stations, "Lyon Part Dieu". You can buy your shuttle
ticket online beforehand if you wish.
From there, you can take a city tramway on the other side of the station.
You can buy a ticket at the tramway stop, but not on the tramway. It's the
line "T1", take it in the direction "Montrochet". After 15 to 20 minutes,
get off at the "Perrache" stop, and you'll find your hotel on the western
side of Place Carnot, less than 100m from the tramway stop "Perrache".
I had suggested a dinner on Sunday evening, but given your various times of
arrival, it might prove  a bit unpractical. Therefore, I suggest that we
make do with a lunch on Monday!

If you're arriving by train, remember that there are 2 main stations in
Lyon: Lyon PArt Dieu, and Lyon Perrache. Trains from Paris stop at Lyon
Part Dieu first, then at Lyon Perrache. If it is the case of your train,
you should get off at Lyon Perrache, which is where your hotel is. In case
you have made a reservation to Lyon Part Dieu only, and if your train stops
at Lyon Perrache after, don't bother with the reservation and stay on the
train until Lyon Perrache, it's much easier than having to transfrer by
tramway from one station to the other.

2) Conference

The conferences will take place at the Universit=E9 Lyon 2, which is about =
10
to 15 minutes by feet from the hotel. The full address is:
Universit=E9 Lumi=E8re Lyon 2, Campus Berges du Rh=F4ne
Salle de s=E9minaire du CIHAM
18 quai Claude bernard 69007 Lyon
b=E2t. B, esc. B2, (sous-sol, B 044)
Finding one's way in the university buildings is notoriously complicated,
so if you ever feel lost or unsure, please phone me on my mobile:
+33670863699, and I'll come with a Search&Rescue team :)

The conference room is far from fancy, I'm afraid, but you will have a
videoprojector and an internet connection (cable, no wireless). If
necessary, I can also provide a laptop.

3) Audience

There is room for about 25 people in the conf. room, and the audience will
be mixed: graduate students quite new to DH (they have just attended an
introductory course), and more seasoned professionals of diverse
specialisms (some of them medievalists wanting to know more about DH, some
of them full fledged digital humanists). Since attendance is free, I can't
tell you what the balance will be, but probably something like half and
half.
I don't know how some of you are familiar with French graduate students?
You will probably find them shier and less responsive than UK graduate
students, since our education system is very much based on the assumption
that "master talks, pupils listens"; but in my experience, if they realize
that the speaker really means to have a discussion, they become responsive
and engaged in the conversation.


Well, that's it, unless you have other questions! :)
Looking forward to meeting you all again,
Marjorie
