            <p>This document arises out of a study commissioned by the TGIR Huma Num in
               collaboration with the CINES. <!-- more bumf expanding these acronyms -->
            </p>
            <p>The object of the study was to identify to promote best practice amongst the
               community of researchers wishing to deposit textual resources encoded using TEI XML
               with the CINES for long term preservation by formulating a series of precise
               recommendations, a Guide to Good Practice. Although the CINES already has extensive
               experience and expertise in the long term preservation of resources respecting
               generic standards such as XML and PDF, it was recognised that the increasing use of
               TEI-XML in the French research community offered both an additional opportunity and a
               challenge. On the one hand, as a more expressive and richer formalism than generic
               XML, TEI offers the possibility of ensuring the preservation of more contextual and
               semantic data forming part of a resource; on the other hand, the ways in which TEI
               XML is applied in practice varies quite widely amongst different researchers, and so
               simply to say that a document is "TEI-conformant" may leave unspecified a great deal
               of useful contextual information about it. </p>
            <p>Although the community of TEI users is highly divers, its members share an
               understanding of the best way to use the TEI Guidelines, just as those Guidelines
               express a common understanding of how the structure and metadata associated with a
               textual resource should be documented and defined. This community of practice has
               been increasing in size and scope quite significantly over the last few years, and
               notably so in France, where a number of large-scale resource-creation projects have
               already expressed a committment to the use of TEI XML, just as several smaller scale
               individual resource projects have adopted and adapted it to their needs. For the
               purposes of this project we approached initially only a small number of projects,
               selecting those which were known to be engaged in the creation of significant amounts
               of TEI-XML material likely to be of long-term interest in the scholarly research
               community. Examples included the Open Edition project (CLEO), which will publishes
               several hundred scholarly books in a TEI format over the next few years; the CNRTL,
               which has long been responsible for creation and distribution of a wide range of
               TEI-encoded language corpora and is a major French partner in CLARIN;
               <!-- some more examples here? --></p>
            <p>The usefulness of TEI-XML as a format for scholarly analysis and interchange is
               widely accepted. However the question arises as whether TEI-encoded resources are
               also suitable for long term preservation purposes : more specifically, if a project
               wishes to ensure long term preservation of its resources, should it archive them in a
               TEI format, or should it regard the TEI format simply as a means to an end, archiving
               only a processed form of the TEI source as HTML or PDF, for example? For projects
               where the TEI form is considered only as a means to the end of displaying the texts,
               this may well be adequate. But since TEI to HTML or TEI to PDF are lossy
               transformations, in which the added value constituted by TEI structural annotation is
               systematically removed this seems in general a less than optimal solution. We would
               like to be able to preserve our digital resources without loss of information, so as
               to facilitate future use of that information by means of technologies not yet in
               existence. Such data-independence was, after all, one of the promises XML (and before
               it SGML) offered.</p>
            <p>If then it is decided to preserve the original TEI XML sources, what other components
               (schema files, stylesheets, etc.) should accompany them when submitting them for long
               term preservation in a digital archive? TEI encoded resources typically contain
               mostly XML-encoded text, possibly with links to files expressed using other commonly
               encountered web formats for graphics or audio; is there advantage to be gained by
               treating them differently from any other XML encoded resource? When such resources
               are deposited in a digital archive, what tools and expertise will the archivist need
               to have available in order to ensure that they are valid and will continue to be
               usable? </p>
            <p> This study attempts to address these questions by providing (in section <ptr
                  target="#rex"/>) <list>
                  <item>recommendations for the data depositor, specifically about what documents
                     should accompany a resource to be archived ; </item>
                  <item>recommendations for the archiving services, specifically about what tools
                     may be used to validate TEI XML documents ; </item>
               </list></p>
            <p>A number of different scenarios are envisaged, depending on the technical expertise
               and other resources available to the depositor (and the archive). We provide some
               technical background on the technologies concerned in section <ptr target="#tech"/>
               below.</p>
         </div>
         <div xml:id="rex">
            <head>Recommendations</head>
            <p>Our first recommendation concerns the <hi>provision of metadata</hi> about the
               source. All TEI-XML files include a component known as the <term>TEI Header</term>,
               which may be very elaborate and detailed, or entirely minimalist. For archival
               purposes, however, we think it may be helpful to propose a specific subset of
               information that should be supplied by the Header for every kind of language
               resource. A project may well supply more metadata than is suggested here; if it
               supplies less, then the description of the resource will be correspondingly weaker
               and less useful. The Archive will be expected to use only the elements specified here
               as the basis of its cataloguing of the resource. </p>
            <p>Our second recommendation concerns the <hi>validation of the source</hi>. We propose
               that depositors should as far as possible ensure that TEI-XML resources are
               accompanied by a file which accurately describes their encoding practices and
               purposes. The most appropriate format for this description would be the TEI-XML
               vocabulary commonly known as ODD, although producing documentation in this format is
               not as yet as well-understood or widely practiced within the TEI community as might
               be desired; a point to which we return below. Documentation in other forms,
               accompanied by validation schemas, are also useful, but they do not necessarily
               guarantee that the resources concerned will be TEI conformant. For this, an ODD is
               necessary. </p>
            <p>In the absence of ODD documentation from which a more appropriate schema may be
               derived, the only validation check possible before a resource can be accepted into
               the Archive will be against the generic TEI_All schema. According to the definition
               of TEI conformance, those parts of a document using the TEI namespace most be valid
               against the TEI All schema, which includes declarations for all possible TEI elements
               and attributes. </p>
            <p>Our third recommendation concerns the <hi>physical organization of the source</hi>. A
               TEI-XML resource is an XML document, the root element of which is either TEI or
               teiCorpus. However, that resource may well be stored in one or more files. Any XML
               document may embed or transclude other XML resources, for example, by use of the
               xInclude standard. A TEI-XML document may also transclude other non-XML documents
               such as graphics or audio. And a TEI XML document frequently references other XML
               documents, without however implying that they should be included in the source
               itself. </p>

            <p>Each TEI resource archived (i.e. each <gi>TEI</gi> or <gi>teiCorpus</gi>) must be accompanied by a formal specification of its schema and documentation of the semantics of  the elements, attributes, datatypes defined by the schema. For the most part, of course, those semantics are as defined in the version of the TEI Guidelines specified by the <att>version</att> attribute on the root element, but since the TEI offers many overlapping ways of doing the same tjhing, it may be necessary to supplement and make more precise the default documentation by means of user-specific documentation. This is provided by means of a free-standing document, referred to here as an ODD.</p></div>
