            <div type="abstract">
                <p>Today's digital library applications still focus on serving up virtual pages for
                    the reader: the metaphor of the book is so pervasive that we can barely see it.
                    But digital texts should go “beyond the page”. Self-evidently, digitization
                    makes it possible to offer cheaper and more accessible simulations of printed or
                    written pages. But this is not enough. Digital applications should enable us to
                    do more with a text, or with a collection of texts, than simply read it from
                    beginning to end, or attach annotations to it for others to read, or do brute
                    force “text mining” on it. The content of the digital library must therefore be
                    enriched, even if this requires the use of techniques which are not currently
                    automatable.</p>
                <p>This talk considers the theoretical context within which such enrichment might be
                    performed and outlines some practical solutions to the problems it involves.
                    When a pre-existing document is digitized, a new kind of document is created.
                    How should this object best be described? Calling on the traditional distinction
                    between text and document, I shall argue that digitization and encoding alike
                    represent the fixing and re-presentation of a set of readings or interpretations
                    of the source. Flexible document grammars such as that of the TEI make it easier
                    to share and integrate such interpretations and thus to build up complex
                    information systems in which the distinction between text and data is
                    increasingly elided.</p>
                <p>If time permits, I will present some examples showing how a TEI encoding of
                    archival documents might support their integration with new or existing
                    prosopographic or bibliographic systems, thus improving the sophistication of
                    the types of analysis that can be made. </p>
