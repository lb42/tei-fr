Dear Lou

In English =96 to be faster:=20

Many sincere thanks for your 3 very intensive days with us teaching XML =
and
TEI and the philosophy and history behind it. I think everybody had a =
great
time and the fact that all those who said on Tuesday they would continue
till the end stayed until Saturday noon is a sign that people really
appreciated what and how you and Elena taught us.

You asked for some feedback earlier this week, which I shall duly send =
now.
I give it as somebody who has been teaching for a long time and always
appreciates feedback likewise (and I have more weaknesses in teaching =
than
fingers and toes together).=20

That time was an issue on all three days may have many reasons. You are =
a
very experienced teacher and know how to calculate, so I guess it is =96 =
like
in my own teaching =96 linked to the fact that in a foreign language one =
talks
slower and has to look for words here and there (but again your French =
is
much better than my is), so that the same amount of information needs =
more
time. Some explanations on the texts are interesting or nice to have, =
but
not as essential as the content. Anecdotes (like the slide on TEI in the
Bhuddist monastery) make the teaching very personal and awake the person
from dozing off in technical details, but in a foreign language, time is
more limited than in one=92s own. I have to critique myself in this =
regard as
some of my comments cost more time than add essential knowledge for the
others.

Your powerpoints and the printed exercises are a very great help also =
for
the future to redo things. Again, my critique focuses on the things that =
I
consider improvable, which make up maybe 5% of the 95% which is great.=20

I have gained much from your shortcuts (ctrl E or shift-ctrl P etc).
Spending a little more time on some essentials in Oxygene might =
alleviate
some problems later, so explaining use, advantages and disadvantages of
author, grid and text view. Or how to make windows reappear that one has
closed.

I loved the very lucid stuff on text vs document.

Maybe a slide with a simple styled word file could explain to even the =
most
anti-technical or ante-technical that everybody uses tagging all the =
time.

It was wonderful to have the personalized examples from stuff that =
people
sent you before the beginning, e.g. Mishna.

Especially for the beginners, I think it was very useful to have =
everything
in French. Thank you so much!

The explanation of the difference =93valid=94 =96 =93well formed=94 did =
not stick deep
enough in my brain (but I understand it NOW from the corresponding =
slide).


Slide 26. XML: r=E8gles du jeu:=20


Later you have a slide with a graph of the structure of such a tree. =
Might
be useful to put it already here.

Namespace is a funny term as funny as espace de nom or Namensraum.
http://www.linguee.fr/francais-anglais/search?source=3Dauto
<http://www.linguee.fr/francais-anglais/search?source=3Dauto&query=3Dname=
space>
&query=3Dnamespace gives some other translations. It is very strange to =
my
ears. Might need an explanation how this was created and where the space
comes from and why it is not simply name. You certainly know that stuff, =
but
it remains an awkward category for me through the whole week.

=20

I only see now that we did indeed have a very thorough way through XML =
in
the beginning. Maybe I doze off during that time or had to treat urgent
email stuff.

=20

Exercises were all very good. Maybe some more home exercises to find =
errors
in files will train our perception to find them. Also working on your =
own
stuff after one has followed step by step your suggestions will lead to =
more
independence (but it is also much more timeconsuming). For example =
sitting
down and doing a data modeling on one=92s own stuff. Your Arabic art =
monuments
was a very smart example!

It was only through your class that i understood that TEI is not a =
standard
but a forum.

=20


The Slide TEI jadis is obsolete.


I think the stuff about what is the TEI is more illuminating towards the =
end
of a course after one has already learned and practiced oneself quite a =
bit,
though in a book, I would also put it in the beginning.

One unit that could have been more extensive is how to navigate and find
fast what one looks for in the TEI guidelines. Going through the =
chapters
and parts was not so helpful I found. Among the slides are a number =
(e.g.
9.2. the TEI Header, or 12.4. Default Text Structure, etc) that show all =
the
tags possible to be used in one of the TEI chapters. I don=92t think =
these are
helpful for the newbie. It is the kind of information to get from the
TEI-Guidelines. It is too much unknown information in very brief time =
with a
glance on a powerpoint (looking on this NOW, after the class sitting
comfortably in a TGV is VERY helpful, but this is another <stage/>). =
More
helpful would be an example project (not only 5 example lines) where =
this
chapter has been particularly well used, such as the Van Gogh stuff you
presented etc. and several other of the excellent examples you do use in
other contexts (btw the mistakes in the Arabic may come from the LateX
conversion not from the original data, cant it be?). Some namespaces are
=93more of the same stuff=94 (i.e. people, place, time) while others are =
very
different (i.e. crossreferences, towns inside countries) and XSLT needs =
more
time. Your example with the list of people was very good. Would have =
been
nice at that very point to externalize this list to another file to see =
how
one can work with two or more files in principle. Could be done with =
your
point on crossreferences. But it needs practice and slow time. Again
distinguishing between those things that are conceptually very similar =
(such
as theater speakers and poetry or text markup) and those that are
conceptually different things (noting coordinates on a picture, =
crossrefs,
abbrevs, gaiji, certainty [I loved that one], nodes and trees,
surface/zone/graphic). VERY helpful and important is the =93limites de =
la
TEI=94.

I would also put the TEI-header as something more theoretical to a later
rather than earlier stage and some practical examples of projects that
actually mine these headers in order to understand what is important and =
how
one can do this the best way.

It would be nice to add a sentence on your own experience with different
commenting strategies (<!--=85) how much, what etc.

Examples po=E9tique and dramatique are easier with a print page layout =
next to
the tagged xml.

I think an example linked to a CSS style sheet right in the beginning =
would
help understanding the process.

I did not understand ODD.

=20

The distinction between classical source, oral source etc (slides 15 =
etc) is
=93more of the same stuff=94.=20

=20

Applying Roma was very good.

XPATH was a dream. Could have spend more time and exercise on this, but =
it
clearly needs another very substantial course.

Also the other transformations with XSLT and boilerplate and so on that
really show the power in the TEI markup.

=20

So, I went through all your slides again and appreciate very much the
richness of what you taught us and the personality how you did it. Do
whatever you like with the feedback written and sent in appreciation.=20

Yours

Daniel

re a number (e.g. 9.2. the TEI Header, or 12.4. Default Text Structure, etc=
) that show all the tags possible to be used in one of the TEI chapters. I =
don&#8217;t think these are helpful for the newbie. It is the kind of infor=
mation to get from the TEI-Guidelines. It is too much unknown information i=
n very brief time with a glance on a powerpoint (looking on this NOW, after=
 the class sitting comfortably in a TGV is VERY helpful, but this is anothe=
r &lt;stage/&gt;). More helpful would be an example project (not only 5 exa=
mple lines) where this chapter has been particularly well used, such as the=
 Van Gogh stuff you presented etc. and several other of the excellent examp=
les you do use in other contexts (btw the mistakes in the Arabic may come f=
rom the LateX conversion not from the original data, cant it be?). Some nam=
espaces are &#8220;more of the same stuff&#8221; (i.e. people, place, time)=
 while others are very different (i.e. crossreferences, towns inside countr=
ies) and XSLT needs more time. Your example with the list of people was ver=
y good. Would have been nice at that very point to externalize this list to=
 another file to see how one can work with two or more files in principle. =
Could be done with your point on crossreferences. But it needs practice and=
 slow time. Again distinguishing between those things that are conceptually=
 very similar (such as theater speakers and poetry or text markup) and thos=
e that are conceptually different things (noting coordinates on a picture, =
crossrefs, abbrevs, gaiji, certainty [I loved that one], nodes and trees, s=
urface/zone/graphic). VERY helpful and important is the &#8220;limites de l=
a TEI&#8221;.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span style=3D"fo=
