  <h1>On a Sonnet made from Numbers and the Philosophy of Meaning</h1>
<p>I must record here for you Reader a most curious Discovery. I was 
investigating the usage of Rhyme in an historical Corpus of English 
Poetry, when, quite accidentally, while mixing together a Sample of 
Iambic Poems from the sixteenth through the twentieth centuries, this 
Poem was randomly generated out of the unseen depths of Chance. And yet I
 think it is a wonderful Poem-a Sonnet in fact, after the Shakespearean 
manner-if perhaps wanting a little in Sense. Nonetheless I count it a 
Discovery: indeed, it reminds me of James Macpherson, who found and 
bravely brought to the World that glorious epic of Ossian. But I digress
 no further: here is the Poem: I have but added certain Punctuation, 
which it lacked entirely:</p>

    </div>
<p>I copy my Procedure below. But now let us address an important 
Question of Philosophy. What is the status of Meaning in this Poem? It 
calls to mind a similar Thought-Experiment: Professors Knapp and 
Michaels' "Against Theory" article in the <em>Critical Inquiry</em> of 
Summer 1982 -- in which the more Wordsworthian Conceit is, that Nature 
herself, while already occupied in splashing about a Beach with the 
Waves of the Sea, somehow manages, quite by Accident, to transcribe in 
perfectly readable English the following words: "A slumber did my spirit
 seal, I had no human fears:" &amp;c. &amp;c. For Profs. K. &amp; M., 
because its creation is by Chance, it cannot be a Poem, nor
bear any Meaning: for Meaning derives from Intentionality.</p>
<p>&lt; span style="color: #993366;"&gt;Let us who pale to look for 
rest, retreat;
&lt; span style="color: #993366;"&gt; Now, vain resistance will but buy 
the task,
&lt; span style="color: #993366;"&gt; And light with smiles indulgent 
chear'd and beat.
&lt; span style="color: #3366ff;"&gt;The lightnings strike: the ende is 
good to ask
&lt; span style="color: #3366ff;"&gt; Thee, save these groves and lawns 
and shades,&lt;/span&lt; span style="color: #ff9900;"&gt;in vain
&lt; span style="color: #ff9900;"&gt; The fortress strong, the cage was 
wood: he chose
&lt; span style="color: #ff9900;"&gt; An ample plain where sickning 
pleasures reign.
&lt; span style="color: #99cc00;"&gt;Or, as her choice flowers, their 
beauty shows
&lt; span style="color: #99cc00;"&gt; From faces heavnly fair, in sight 
the black
&lt; span style="color: #99cc00;"&gt; Rock's side or flowry glade: <span style="color: #ff9900;">a deep abyss</span>
&lt; span style="color: #ff9900;"&gt; Prostrate he lies, enrowl'd now all the pack
&lt; span style="color: #ff9900;"&gt; And first is fed&lt;/span&lt; span style="color: #99cc00;"&gt;fancy, who with a kisse,
&lt; span style="color: #99cc00;"&gt; Was sealed to keep their fainty hopes alive.
&lt; span style="color: #ff9900;"&gt;But soon, shall prove thine utmost ire and drive.</p>
<p>But is this fascinating Sonnet, another Accident of Sorts, really not a Poem? -- with no Meaning whatsoever? <em>Absurd</em>, in my Opinion. Look for instance at<span style="color: #800080;"> the poem's opening pastoral affect, surrounding the Vanity of Ambition and the Virtue of Rest</span>; followed by the <span style="color: #3366ff;">prophesy of the End of Days</span>; and then the ensuing, strange, gendered Dialectic, in which <span style="color: #ff9900;">a Male Persona ("he") of "sickning pleasures"</span> alternates with<span style="color: #339966;"> a Female Persona ("her") of "choice flowers" and "faces heavnly fair"</span>.
 I could walk out this interpretation Further -- and will -- in this 
footnote.[1. The Poem begins with a rhetorical stance, speaking in the 
imperative tense: those who pale at the thought of finding Rest, should 
retreat from their position: their vain Resistance to the Wisdom of Rest
 will but force them to need more of it, as their indulgent Smiles, 
requiring so much Effort, give them a Light that is "chear'd and <em>beat</em>."
 Then the Poet reminds us of the End of Days: "the lightnings strike" 
and "the End is good to ask thee", to give you this Opportunity and 
Time, now,  now before the End comes, to save these "groves and lawns 
and shades," that is, places of mental Serenity and Rest. "In vain" is 
the aggressive, ambitious, "man"-made fortress or cage: beauty's "choice
 flowers" are instead the "black rock's side" and "flowry glade." Truly 
the fortress of the Male Persona is a "deep abyss" on which he is 
"prostrate," no Fortress or Cage. But to him is given "Fancy," a 
sexualized and feminized Persona calling back to a few lines above, and 
who ominously "was sealed," in the passive voice, "to keep their fainty 
hopes alive." A bleak ending of domestic tragedy, except for the last 
line: "but soon," these "fainty hopes" of "thine," perhaps referring to 
both the Female and to the Male Personas, will Polarize to become "Ire 
and Drive" -- an emotional Ambiguity of Indignation and a new, fresher 
Ambition.] But in a word, I mean to say: <em>this is a Poem.</em> As a 
raindrop falls down a Window -- unpredictably, and yet likely to follow 
the Channels of prior Drops -- so this Sonnet wrote itself by falling 
down the Grooves made, not by Nature's idle unthinking Waves, but by 
thousands of English Iambic Poems across the last five Centuries.</p>
<p>Herein lies the Problem with the Account of Knapp and Michaels: 
Nature could never write a Poem. They ask us to take this Falsity on 
Premise, but it is a Devious Falsity, for it obscures the Nature of 
those Forces that bring a Poem into being. Although constructed from an 
historically distributed Sample, this Poem has a predominant flavor of 
the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, perhaps given its Seed Words, 
"let us", with their monosyllabic Diction and prayer-like Invocation. 
But in any case, from this origin, to travel the Markov Chain of English
 Iambic Poetry is, <em>for some reason</em>, to travel through a 
thematics of Ambition versus Rest; of an interesting, and problematic, 
gendered Polarity of Affect, between Fancy and Delight on the one hand, 
and Aggression and Dissolution on the other. What gives these Thematics 
meaning, in this Accidental Poem, is identical to what gives meaning to 
the Thematics of a "Real" Poem: the Forces that led Language to take on 
this particular Shape and Pattern. In a Poet, these Forces are personal 
as well as literary, social, historical, &amp;c.: here, while not 
personal, the Forces embedded in the Markov Chain are perhaps still more
 deeply historical, cultural, literary, and political.[2. Indeed, the 
Poem can be said to be Misogynist. Why are Women so strongly associated 
with Flowers, and Fancy, and such, that they appear only among them in a
 Random Voyage through Poetic History? The Feminist or Sexual Politics 
of Language is perhaps still <em>more</em> resonant here.] They 
represent a muted Afterglow of Poetry's English History, an Afterglow 
which in spite of itself retains a Specificity of Meaning. For the 
eminent Philosopher of Events and Action, Donald Davidson, Reasons are 
Causes of Actions. So too here: Reasons are Causes of Poetry, even as 
these Reasons are de-personalized from Intentionality, per se -- one 
could say that the ghost of Wordsworth is dispelled -- to become instead
 a more persuasive, complex Form of Meaning: Forces and Causes; Grooves,
 and Raindrops.</p>

<li>From 800 Poems sampled from each of eight Historical Periods as 
annotated in Chadwyck-Healy's Corpus of Poetry, from the Tudor Period to
 the 20th Century</li>

<li>construct two Markov Chains
<ol>
<li>for words within lines only (to maximize Sense and Syntax)</li>
<li>for all words in the poem</li>
</ol></li>
<li>a "Chain" meaning that for every three words (n1 + n2 + n3), increase in your Data the probability of (n3) given (n1 + n2)</li>
<li>this then allows, from a chosen starting point of an arbitrary (n1 +
 n2), a "random" decision of the next word, (n3), but weighted by the 
probability of (n3) derived from the foregoing operation, number 4.</li>
<li>Then (n2 + n3) become the new (n1 + n2), and predict a new (n3) in its turn, and so on ad infinitum, <em>in potentia</em>.</li>
<li>To generate a Pentameter Poem, however, run the Model (from the 
initial Seed Words [here, "let us"]) as many times as necessary until:
<ol>
<li>a perfect 10 Syllable Line is created</li>
<li>whose last word is not a function word</li>
<li>whose last two words were observed somewhere in the Corpus [to further prohibit ending on Syntactic Words]</li>
<li>and which, if necessary, rhymes with the appropriate line.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Once the first Line is created, the next line is generated using the
 Seed Words of the last two Words of the first Line -- but only Lines 
generated that satisfy the above Conditions are accepted, all others are
 discarded, into a Heap of Combinations of English Words perhaps never 
before Seen, and perhaps, never after</li>
<li>The lines can be given a Rhyme Scheme to follow. In this case the scheme is the following: "A B A B C D C D E F E F G G."</li>
<li>Rhymes are defined as a Correspondence of Phonemes in the Nucleus and Coda of the Final Syllable of two Lines.</li>
<li>Use the Within-Line Markov Model when within a Line, whenever possible; otherwise switch to the All Words Model</li>
