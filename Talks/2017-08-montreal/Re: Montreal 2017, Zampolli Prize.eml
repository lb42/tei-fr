Here is a proposal, then.  We speak in the order Nancy, Michael, Lou,
on (roughly) the topics

Nancy: How/why was the TEI started in the first place?  (as described
above) What problems was TEI trying to solve?

Michael: How did TEI try to solve those problems?  What were the core
technical, procedural, and design decisions of TEI?  (And how well
have they held up in practice?)

(A: Poughkeepsie Principles; use of descriptive markup; in-document
metadata; prefer document grammars that over-generate to those that
under-generate; extensibility and customizability; modularity of tag
set; use of open standards; focus on document format, not software.)

Lou: Given that the TEI is by now so very old, why is it still here?
(A: because it apparently does useful work; because it evolves.)

Lou's discussion of why the TEI is still here can perhaps lead
naturally to the observation that one reason the TEI is still here is
that there is a community which has accepted ownership of the
Guidelines and has invested a great deal of time and effort over the
years in maintaining them, improving them, and using them.  The three
of us are on the stage because the stage is not big enough to hold the
entire TEI community, but it is to the community, and not to us as
individuals, that the Zampolli Prize has been awarded.  This would
lead naturally to what Lou has generously described as our coup de
theatre.  Lou asks the current or past members of the TEI Council to
stand.  Nancy asks all current or past members of the Board to
stand. Michael asks current or past members of TEI-C working groups or
the old TEI Technical Review Committee to stand.  Michael asks anyone
who has ever published an article or given a talk criticizing the TEI
or the Guidelines to stand, since by subjecting the Guidelines to
critical scrutiny they are an important part of the community.
Session dissolves in general good feeling and an urgent desire to go
to the reception and get something to drink.


Would that work for you?

Michael
