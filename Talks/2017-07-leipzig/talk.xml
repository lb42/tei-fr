            <p>From the very beginning, the TEI has concerned itself with <hi>Guidelines</hi> about

         <div>
            <head>Scholarly communities</head>
            <p>Historically speaking, the TEI came about as the result of an unusual coincidence of
               interests amongst.. <list>
                  <item>literary scholars interested in stylistics, genre theorists, devotees of
                        <soCalled>close reading</soCalled> ... </item>

            <head>Interdisciplinarity</head>
            <p>The TEI was probably one of the first great interdisciplinary efforts of its period.
               The members of its committees were drawn from many different academic specialisms,
               having in common only an interest in <q>the digital turn</q>. </p>
            <p>This goes some way to explain two of its more striking architectural characteristics
               – <list>
                  <item>the widespread application of Ockham's razor </item>
                  <item>the insistence on customizability</item>
               </list>
            </p>
         </div>

         <div>
            <head>Other oppositions</head>
            <p>Then as now, the TEI (and indeed the <soCalled>digital humanities</soCalled>) needed
               to negotiate two contradictions: <list rend="numbered">
                  <item>the needs of beginners and the needs of experts</item>
                  <item>the needs of scholars and the needs of technicians </item>

                  required to be aware </item>
               <item>On the other, the TEI should <hi>support research,</hi> and hence permit the
                  discovery of solutions to questions not yet asked or askable -- thus allowing

                  solutions, easily implemented with current technologies </item>
               <item>On the other, the TEI formal model is expressed in a way that is accessible to
                  the non-technician, and derives from a set of concepts familiar to those with
                  knowledge of the human sciences</item>

            <p>Despite its name, the TEI is not concerned only with textual data. Even in its first

               <item>A new version of TEI P5 appears approximately twice a year, usually containing
                  corrected errors, new examples, clearer documentation etc. But new features also
                  appear... </item>
               <item> The <soCalled>Birnbaum Doctrine</soCalled> requires that existing features
                  should be retained (unless they are really broken): a document conformant with the
                  first release of P5, should remain conformant with all subsequent versions </item>
               <item> When an existing feature is changed or withdrawn, it must go through a process
                  of <soCalled>deprecation</soCalled>, lasting 6 months to a year, during which its
                  imminent demise will be signalled explicitly by any TEI processor. </item>

                  <item>they provoke a <soCalled>not invented here</soCalled> reaction: the

                  <item>add constraints limiting e.g. the possible values of attributes </item>
                  <item>add constraints on element content or co-occurrence, e.g. with ISO
                     Schematron</item>
                  <item>add new elements or classes of elements within a non-TEI namespace,
                     integrating them within predefined TEI model classes</item>
