            <p>This document arises out of a study commissioned by the TGIR Huma Num in
               collaboration with the CINES. <!-- more bumf expanding these acronyms -->
            </p>
            <p>The object of the study was to identify to promote best practice amongst the
               community of researchers wishing to deposit textual resources encoded using TEI XML
               with the CINES for long term preservation by formulating a series of precise
               recommendations, a Guide to Good Practice. Although the CINES already has extensive
               experience and expertise in the long term preservation of resources respecting
               generic standards such as XML and PDF, it was recognised that the increasing use of
               TEI-XML in the French research community offered both an additional opportunity and a
               challenge. On the one hand, as a more expressive and richer formalism than generic
               XML, TEI offers the possibility of ensuring the preservation of more contextual and
               semantic data forming part of a resource; on the other hand, the ways in which TEI
               XML is applied in practice varies quite widely amongst different researchers, and so
               simply to say that a document is "TEI-conformant" may leave unspecified a great deal
               of useful contextual information about it. </p>
            <p>Although the community of TEI users is highly divers, its members share an
               understanding of the best way to use the TEI Guidelines, just as those Guidelines
               express a common understanding of how the structure and metadata associated with a
               textual resource should be documented and defined. This community of practice has
               been increasing in size and scope quite significantly over the last few years, and
               notably so in France, where a number of large-scale resource-creation projects have
               already expressed a committment to the use of TEI XML, just as several smaller scale
               individual resource projects have adopted and adapted it to their needs. For the
               purposes of this project we approached initially only a small number of projects,
               selecting those which were known to be engaged in the creation of significant amounts
               of TEI-XML material likely to be of long-term interest in the scholarly research
               community. Examples included the Open Edition project (CLEO), which will publishes
               several hundred scholarly books in a TEI format over the next few years; the CNRTL,
               which has long been responsible for creation and distribution of a wide range of
               TEI-encoded language corpora and is a major French partner in CLARIN;
               <!-- some more examples here? --></p>
            <p>The usefulness of TEI-XML as a format for scholarly analysis and interchange is
               widely accepted. However the question arises as whether TEI-encoded resources are
               also suitable for long term preservation purposes : more specifically, if a project
               wishes to ensure long term preservation of its resources, should it archive them in a
               TEI format, or should it regard the TEI format simply as a means to an end, archiving
               only a processed form of the TEI source as HTML or PDF, for example? For projects
               where the TEI form is considered only as a means to the end of displaying the texts,
               this may well be adequate. But since TEI to HTML or TEI to PDF are lossy
               transformations, in which the added value constituted by TEI structural annotation is
               systematically removed this seems in general a less than optimal solution. We would
               like to be able to preserve our digital resources without loss of information, so as
               to facilitate future use of that information by means of technologies not yet in
               existence. Such data-independence was, after all, one of the promises XML (and before
               it SGML) offered.</p>
            <p>If then it is decided to preserve the original TEI XML sources, what other components
               (schema files, stylesheets, etc.) should accompany them when submitting them for long
               term preservation in a digital archive? TEI encoded resources typically contain
               mostly XML-encoded text, possibly with links to files expressed using other commonly
               encountered web formats for graphics or audio; is there advantage to be gained by
               treating them differently from any other XML encoded resource? When such resources
               are deposited in a digital archive, what tools and expertise will the archivist need
               to have available in order to ensure that they are valid and will continue to be
               usable? </p>
            <p> This study attempts to address these questions by providing (in section <ptr
                  target="#rex"/>) <list>
                  <item>recommendations for the data depositor, specifically about what documents
                     should accompany a resource to be archived ; </item>
                  <item>recommendations for the archiving services, specifically about what tools
                     may be used to validate TEI XML documents ; </item>
               </list></p>
            <p>A number of different scenarios are envisaged, depending on the technical expertise
               and other resources available to the depositor (and the archive). We provide some
               technical background on the technologies concerned in section <ptr target="#tech"/>
               below.</p>

            <head>Recommendations</head>
            <p>Our first recommendation concerns the <hi>provision of metadata</hi> about the
               source. All TEI-XML files include a component known as the <term>TEI Header</term>,
               which may be very elaborate and detailed, or entirely minimalist. For archival
               purposes, however, we think it may be helpful to propose a specific subset of
               information that should be supplied by the Header for every kind of language
               resource. A project may well supply more metadata than is suggested here; if it
               supplies less, then the description of the resource will be correspondingly weaker
               and less useful. The Archive will be expected to use only the elements specified here
               as the basis of its cataloguing of the resource. </p>
            <p>Our second recommendation concerns the <hi>validation of the source</hi>. We propose
               that depositors should as far as possible ensure that TEI-XML resources are
               accompanied by a file which accurately describes their encoding practices and
               purposes. The most appropriate format for this description would be the TEI-XML
               vocabulary commonly known as ODD, although producing documentation in this format is
               not as yet as well-understood or widely practiced within the TEI community as might
               be desired; a point to which we return below. Documentation in other forms,
               accompanied by validation schemas, are also useful, but they do not necessarily
               guarantee that the resources concerned will be TEI conformant. For this, an ODD is
               necessary. </p>
            <p>In the absence of ODD documentation from which a more appropriate schema may be
               derived, the only validation check possible before a resource can be accepted into
               the Archive will be against the generic TEI_All schema. According to the definition
               of TEI conformance, those parts of a document using the TEI namespace most be valid
               against the TEI All schema, which includes declarations for all possible TEI elements
               and attributes. </p>
            <p>Our third recommendation concerns the <hi>physical organization of the source</hi>. A
               TEI-XML resource is an XML document, the root element of which is either TEI or
               teiCorpus. However, that resource may well be stored in one or more files. Any XML
               document may embed or transclude other XML resources, for example, by use of the
               xInclude standard. A TEI-XML document may also transclude other non-XML documents
               such as graphics or audio. And a TEI XML document frequently references other XML
               documents, without however implying that they should be included in the source
               itself. </p>

            <head>Provision of Metadata</head>
            <p>A <gi>teiHeader</gi> element must be provided for each distinct <gi>TEI</gi> or
                  <gi>teiCorpus</gi> element in a resource. We recommend the following steps as part
               of the accession process: <list>
                  <item>Each header should be validated against a strict schema (to be supplied)
                     which will check the existence of required components listed below;</item>
                  <item>Each header will be modified, as a minimum to indicate that the header has
                     been validated for accession, and possibly also to indicate any significant
                     gaps found, as indicated below.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Multiple <term>levels</term> of metadata may be provided in the case of a
                  <gi>teiCorpus</gi>. For example, some information may relate to the corpus as a
               whole (for example, its title, the purpose for which it was created, its distributor,
               etc); other information may relate only to individual components of it (for example,
               the bibliographic description of an individual source text), or to groups of such
               components (for example, a taxonomic classification).</p>

               <head>Corpus identification</head>
               <p>Under this heading we group information that identifies the resource, and
                  specifies the agencies responsible for its creation and distribution. <list>
                     <item>name of resource (<gi>title</gi> within <gi>titleStmt</gi>)

                     <item>producer (<gi>respStmt</gi> within <gi>titleStmt</gi>). The agency
                        (individuals, research group, "principle investigator", company, institution
                        etc.) responsible for the intellectual content of the resource must be
                        specified. [required] </item>
                     <item>Information about any funding body or sponsor involved may also be
                        supplied using the <gi>funder</gi> element.</item>
                     <item> A <gi>publicationStmt</gi> is also required within the
                        <gi>fileDesc</gi>. If the resource has been formally published or
                        distributed, this will contain details of the agency (individual, research
                        group, company, institution etc) concerned; if not, it will contain text
                        stating that the resource has not been formally published. The following
                        elements may be used: <list>

                              and may also indicate additional restrictions, e.g. where the corpus
                              may not be distributed in some geographic zones, or for some specific
                              purposes. </item>

               <head>Source derivation</head>
               <p>Under this heading we group information that describes the sources from which the
                  resource was derived. </p>
               <p>TEI-XML resources may be derived from many different kinds of object. A
                     <gi>sourceDescription</gi> is required for each distinct source. Depending on
                  its nature, this will contain one of the following : <list>
                     <item><gi>bibl</gi> or <gi>biblStruct</gi> for books, newspapers, pamphlets
                        etc. originally printed; </item>
                     <item><gi>msDesc</gi> for unique manuscript archival documents or inscriptions; </item>
                     <item><gi>p</gi> or <gi>note</gi> for unpublished

               <p>All of these elements have their own detailed substructure, concerning which we
                  make no particular recommendations, since their use will be highly
                  project-specific. For archival purposes, it is required only that at least one of
                  the elements listed above appear. In the case of conventionally printed and
                  published material, a standard bibliographic description should be supplied or
                  referenced, using the usual conventions (author, title, publisher, date, ISBN,
                  etc.), and using a standard citation format. For other kinds of material,
                  different data is appropriate: for example, in transcripts of spoken data it is
                  customary to supply demographic information about each speaker, and the context in
                  which the speech interaction occurs. Standards defining the range of such
                  information for the use of particular research communities should be followed (for
                  example, defined by CLARIN) where appropriate. </p>
               <p>Other components of the <gi>fileDesc</gi> element such as <gi>extent</gi> may be
                  used, but are not required.</p>

            <div xml:id="D1enc">
               <head>Encoding description</head>
               <p>The second major subdivision of the TEI header is contained by an optional
                     <gi>encodingDesc</gi> element, and may potentially contain a very large number
                  of semi-structured metadata elements covering most aspects of the process by which
                  a source has been encoded. Its function thus overlaps with that of the ODD file
                  discussed in section <ptr target="#rec2"/>. Components of this element specify the
                  methods and editorial principles which governed the transcription or encoding of
                  the resource and may also include sets of coded definitions used by other
                  components. The following elements, many of which have quite extensive
                  substructure, are potentially available: <list>

               <p> Although such information will be of considerable importance and usefulness for
                  the correct usage of a resource, there is as yet very little agreement or common
                  practice in the way it should be recorded in the header, some projects providing
                  extensive documentation, and others none at all. For our purposes, therefore, we
                  recommend only that the <gi>projectDesc</gi> element be supplied. This element is
                  used to state explicitly the project goals and research agenda associated with the
                  creation of the resource. The persons or agencies directly responsible will
                  already have been mentioned as a part of identifying the resource; the purpose of
                  this section is to provide further background on such matters as the purposes for
                  which the corpus was created, its design goals, its theoretical framework or
                  context, its intended usage, target audience etc. Although such information is of
                  necessity impressionistic and anecdotal, it can be very helpful to the user
                  seeking to determine the potential relevance of the resource to their own needs. </p>
               <p>If other descriptive elements are supplied, they will be archived along with the

               <p>This optional element is used to record significant stages in the evolution of a
                  resource. It should contain a series of <gi>change</gi> elements, in reverse
                  chronological order, most recent first. We recommend that at least one such
                     <gi>change</gi> element be supplied in order to record the date of archiving of
                  the source. If this is not present, then it should be added during the
                  accessioning process.</p>

            <p>Each TEI resource archived (i.e. each <gi>TEI</gi> or <gi>teiCorpus</gi>) must be
               accompanied by a formal specification of its schema and documentation of the
               semantics of the elements, attributes, datatypes defined by the schema. For the most
               part, of course, those semantics are as defined in the version of the TEI Guidelines
               specified by the <att>version</att> attribute on the root element, but since the TEI
               offers many overlapping ways of doing the same thing, it may be necessary to
               supplement and make more precise the default documentation by means of user-specific
               documentation. This is provided by means of a free-standing document, referred to
               here as an ODD.</p>

            <head>Physical Organization</head>
            <p>A TEI XML object, for the purposes of accessioning, should contain the whole of the root TEI or teiCorpus element. If portions of this document are embedded by means of xInclude statements or other URI reference, resolving these should be as simple as possible. For that reason, we recommend that before the object is archived its components should be moved to a simple directory structure, in which each xIncluded file is at the same level, and each embedded graphic or other media file is moved to a single <q>Media</q> directory at the same level. This in turn will require some modification of the existing source files, to ensure that URIs continue to be valid. </p>
            <p>For example consider the following imaginary TEI XML fragment:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[
                 <body><include xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../part1.xml"/>
                  <p>
                     This is some text containing a pointer <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org"/>
                  </p>
                    <include  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="/home/demo/TEIstuff/part2.xml"/>
                  <figure><graphic url="pic.png"/></figure>
                  <media
                     mimeType="video/mp4"
                     url="media/clip45.mp4"
                     dur="PT45M"
                     width="500px">
                     <desc>A 45 minute video clip to be displayed in a window 500
                        px wide </desc>
                  </media>

               ]]></egXML>
               In this fragment, the contents of the files <ident>../part1.xml</ident> and <ident>/home/demo/TEIstuff/part2.xml</ident> should preferably be obtained <hi>before archiving is carried out</hi> and inserted at the appropriate place in the source. If this is not appropriate (perhaps because the resulting file would be too large), the files concerned should be included within the archival package at the same level in the filestructure as the file containing the fragment quoted here, and the <att>href</att> values modified accordingly. </p>
            <p>The values of each of the attributes <att>target</att>, <att>url</att>, and <att>ref</att> should be checked during accession to ensure that the resource indicated by the URI is accessible. This can be done for XML content by means of an XSLT2 stylesheet, using the doc-available() and resolve-uri() built-in functions. In the general case however the only reliable way of checking a URI seems to be to follow it, using a tool such as <ident>curl</ident> to access the HTTP header for the indicated URL and then processing that.
