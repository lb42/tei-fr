This project is intended to produce a TEI conformant detailed bibliography of the works included in the LIVRESC database (see http://my.yoolib.com/bubljdlec/)
The format used should be applicable to further additions to this database.

The existing database, dumped in an idiosyncratic XML form, is in the file Baselivresc.xml
The stylesheet for converting it to TEI is in the file Baselivresc.xsl

The stylesheet metaGen.xsl generates a dummy template for each distinct meta@type in the input.
The resulting templates are in metaGen.xml, from which they are copied into Baselivresc.xsl

It doesnt yet handle the detailed category data. This may require a TEI extension.
