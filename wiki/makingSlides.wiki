#summary how to generate PDF slides from TEI XML
= Introduction =

The XML source files here are used to generate PDF in two stages.
 * first by converting the TEI to LaTeX
 * second by processing the LaTeX with an appropriate set of macros, provided by the XeLaTeX package

SFAIK this only works on Linux

= Prerequisite packages =

You need the TEI stylesheets, an XSLT version2 processor such as saxon, XeLaTex package, TeX etc etc.

For full explanation of the TEI stylesheets, see http://www.tei-c.org/Tools/Stylesheets/

There is a Makefile in each folder containing talks. It assumes you have installed
 * *saxon* from  http://saxon.sourceforge.net 
 * *xelatex* is included with a full Tex Live (http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) installation, I believe. 

Try the following to install everything:

{{{
sudo apt-get install latex-beamer texlive-xetex texlive 
}}}
