#summary BVH validation

= Notes on current BVH encoding praxis =

*TEI* 

  * @version ("5.0") : no longer valid : two occurrences to remove
  * @xml:base : ?valid "The attribute xml:base may be inserted in XML documents to specify a base URI *other than* the base URI of the  document or external entity." according to the spec. However, what we see here is the root filename. Strictly speaking all #xxx type links will be interpreted relative to this, which is probably not what was intended.
  * @xml:id : these are valid though verbose : introduce a shorter version ?
  * @xml:lang : missing on one doc; fra(48) shd really be fr(1)
