#summary BVH validation

= Notes on current BVH encoding praxis =

*TEI* 

  * @version ("5.0") : no longer valid : two occurrences to remove
  * @xml:base : ?valid "The attribute xml:base may be inserted in XML documents to specify a base URI *other than* the base URI of the  document or external entity." according to the spec. However, what we see here is the root filename. Strictly speaking all #xxx type links will be interpreted relative to this, which is probably not what was intended.
  * @xml:id : these are valid though verbose : introduce a shorter version ?
  * @xml:lang : missing on one doc; fra(48) shd really be fr(1)

*ab* (1012)
  All but 8 specify a @rend, which in all but 11  ="runon" ; also specified on parent &lt;sp>. 
  1 only supplies @type="note" : this seems redundant 

*abbr* (1610)
  One and one only has a value (IDBA) for its xml:id. Why?

*add*
  * @hand some values are unresolvable pointers; 5 (of 36) are just words
  * @type="provenance" occurs twice. Why?
  * @xml:id used twice only


*sp*

In 1010 cases, the speech is encoded within an <ab>; in 724 within a <p> : should be consistent
