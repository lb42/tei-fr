Details of plenaries are not included here (see BernePlenaries); they take place each morning between 09 and 10 and each afternoon between 14 and 15h. I'm assuming that (if there is one) there is a coffee break between the end of the plenary and the start of the atelier both in the morning and the afternoon.
